usage: python3 code{problem_number}.py
my python version : Python 3.6.9

running code4.py needs to input the key value for caesar cipher.
code4.py and code5.py work correctly most of the time, but they sometimes raise error for some reasons I am not sure.
generate_table.py will generates a rainbow table with chain length=150.
code6.py needs that rainbow table to run.
